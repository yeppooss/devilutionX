# Contribution Guide

This guide outlines useful resources, tools and processes for contribution to
DevilutionX.

## C++ Standard

Despite setting C++ standard to 20 in CMakeLists.txt, features from this version are not being used.
The oldest compiler used is GCC 6.5 - and that defines our C++ feature set (meaning most of C++17).
It's present only to take advantage of fmt::format build time errors.

## Code style guide

[The code style guide](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Code-Style) is evolving with the project.
